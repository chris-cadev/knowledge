title: ðŸŒ±if statement explosions
tags:

it is like [class explosions](content/Extracts/class explosions.md) but this happens when you have like to much things to choose from and you tackle that using if statements
example:
```js
if (x instanceof A) {
	// do something
}
if (x instanceof B) {
	// do something else
}
if (x instanceof C) {
	// do something else
}
if (x instanceof D) {
	// do something else
}
if (x instanceof E) {
	// do something else
}
if (x instanceof F) {
	// do something else
}
```

it is related to a bad smell, [Conditional Complexity](content/Extracts/Conditional Complexity.md)
