# resolve issue of No useable version of libssl

>The fix that worked for me was manually downloading the 'libssl1.0.0_1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.8_amd64.deb' package from http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl1.0/
>then, in the download location:
``` bash
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.0.0_1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.8_amd64.deb
```
