I will use [Quartz 3](content/Bibliography/Quartz 3.md) to make it happen.

---
- revisit an old vault to get the reference of [Quartz 3](content/Bibliography/Quartz 3.md)
- clone [quartz template from github](content/Extracts/quartz template from github.md) from the repository
- install the dependencies
	- go -> https://go.dev/doc/install
	- hugo -> https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#linux
	- hugo-obsidian -> go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest
- install the path for go binaries
- run the server template without changes
- change the content folder and fail because of the names
- review [flow idea to publish notes without issues](content/Extracts/flow idea to publish notes without issues.md) from and old vault of notes
