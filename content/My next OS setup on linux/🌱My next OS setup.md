# single boot, linux
## Disadventages
- short of gaming (dont care)
## Adventages
- Learn to use linux by imposioning to use it

# dual boot, windows & linux
## Disadventages
- I will not use the full power of linux
	- for example run a server while you are working in another thing
- boot a system to use some specific software
## Adventages
- full gamming
- partial power of servers
