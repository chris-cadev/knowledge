## History behind these steps
When I was working in [[üå±Rainbow triangle|Rainbow triangle]] I was searching for game engines to work with. Since [[üå±Rainbow triangle|Rainbow Triangle]] is a simple game from my perspective I was trying to use something ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to use, so I tried [[Skia]] with [[React Native]] at first was easy, but then it was a mess. So I was deciding between [[Flutter]] and [[Unity]]. And then when I was searching ‚Äúhow to install [[Unity]] in Ubuntu" I notice that some tutorials were complicated and not working for my version of [[ubuntu]] (22.04 LTS). So I found a [[How to install Unity3D on Ubuntu 20.04|tutorial]] where I just got that [[easier to download the appimage of unity|I need the appimage]]. Then I got to [[ubuntu-unity quick setup|a gist in github]] where [[mikenizo808]] explains how to install all the necessary things to make unity works in Ubuntu. Applying those steps work to open the editor, but a compiled time issue comes to the editor ‚Äú[[No useable version of libssl]]‚Äù. Searching a little got me to [[Workaround for libssl issue on Ubuntu 22.04|the post]] of [[AlfieBooth]]. There he explains how to he solved.
