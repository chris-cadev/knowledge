## History behind these steps
When I was working in [üå±Rainbow triangle](/üå±Rainbow%20triangle.md) I was searching for game engines to work with. Since [üå±Rainbow triangle](/üå±Rainbow%20triangle.md) is a simple game from my perspective I was trying to use something ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to use, so I tried [[Skia]] with [[React Native]] at first was easy, but then it was a mess. So I was deciding between [[Flutter]] and [[Unity]]. And then when I was searching ‚Äúhow to install [[Unity]] in Ubuntu" I notice that some tutorials were complicated and not working for my version of [[ubuntu]] (22.04 LTS). So I found a [How to install Unity3D on Ubuntu 20.04](/Bibliography/How%20to%20install%20Unity3D%20on%20Ubuntu%2020.04.md) where I just got that [easier to download the appimage of unity](/Extracts/easier%20to%20download%20the%20appimage%20of%20unity.md). Then I got to [ubuntu-unity quick setup](/Bibliography/ubuntu-unity%20quick%20setup.md) where [[mikenizo808]] explains how to install all the necessary things to make unity works in Ubuntu. Applying those steps work to open the editor, but a compiled time issue comes to the editor ‚Äú[[No useable version of libssl]]‚Äù. Searching a little got me to [Workaround for libssl issue on Ubuntu 22.04](/Bibliography/Workaround%20for%20libssl%20issue%20on%20Ubuntu%2022.04.md) of [[AlfieBooth]]. There he explains how to he solved.
