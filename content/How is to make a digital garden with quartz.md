#tech/web 
- problem with baseURL and github actions
	- probably could be solved by just switching visibility
- issue exporting content from an non quartz formated vault
	- `content_to_quartz_format.sh`
- journey importing linked notes with my zettelkasten notes
- it lacks of custom formating from the principal vault
- i do not like to have my content managed in the same folder I write scripts to deal with the website (github pages)
