This directory tree was working so well for me these months (since 2022-05-12). There is some knowledge that I need to pass to this one in the next months. But, the main objective of this knowledge base is to generate content about the topics listed in: [ðŸŒ±Sobre este knowledge-base](/ðŸŒ±Sobre%20este%20knowledge-base.md).
